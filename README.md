# MultiModel Demo Notes

## Before you begin

Create a Namespace - `Multimodel` - you won't need Interoperability so uncheck that. 
This repository is a Java maven application.  You'll need both Java 8 and maven installed.

You also need to have the InterSystems IRIS Java client libraries as part of your maven cache.  If you haven't done so already, this can be done by a command similar to this:
```
mvn install:install-file -Dfile="c:\InterSystems\IRIS\dev\java\lib\JDK18\intersystems-jdbc-3.1.0.jar" -DgroupId="com.intersystems" -DartifactId=intersystems-jdbc -Dversion="3.1.0" -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true
```
You need to do this for the JDBC and the XEP jar files.

Note that on a really recent release (such as 2021.2), the paths will look slightly different:
```
mvn install:install-file -Dfile="c:\InterSystems\IRIS\dev\java\lib\1.8\intersystems-jdbc-3.2.0.jar" -DgroupId="com.intersystems" -DartifactId=intersystems-jdbc -Dversion="3.2.0" -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true
```

You might want to read the SUMMIT_README file in this directory for a bit more info on the basic concept

## Demo the Object Model
1. Start VS Code in this directory. 
2. Run `mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="demo._Main"`
3. Press 1 to create the participant schema.  Observe via DBeaver the schema that's created.
4. Press 3 to populate the participants.  Observe how Address and PhoneNum are handled.

## Demo the SQL Model
1. Start DBeaver
2. Run the SQL to create the schema.  Observe that a class is now created in IRIS.
3. Populate the table

## Demo the Document Model
1. Start Postman
2. Create the DocDB.  Observe the schema.
3. Create the properties
4. Insert a single document. Observe the schema
5. Populate the table - Go back to Java and press option 5 to create a ton of dummy test results

## Demo the KeyValue Model
1. TBD

## Demo Reporting/Querying across models
1. TBD - more fancy queries in DBeaver, most likely.  Maybe option to show off ISC Reports?

## Demo Cubes
1. TBD - Create the cube, maybe switch to Hole Foods if the data just isn't very interesting?

## Discuss further
1. Reminder - the power is that data is stored in infinitely-variable globals.  Structure is given via classes.  Classes are extensible.
2. Show some neat things done by the community - graph, geospatial, color index (note embedded py)



# Random Notes

Overview
* The demo overview
* Object model
    * in Java => XEP create database. 
    * Populate database. 
    * Show that the objects are now available in IRIS
    * Show that the data is now available in SQL
    * Should we show sub-objects? - we should have good answers about when is appropriate to use XEP and when it isn't.  
    * Talk about future full binding?
    * They will ask about versioning - good answers?
    * Mention hibernate for complex structures, but it's an ORM and not really a true Object model
* Document model
    * In Postman, create the database
    * Populate the database
    * Show that the objects are not available in IRIS
    * Show that the data is now available in SQL
    * Add some properties
    * Query based on the properties in REST, then in SQL
* Key-Value model
    * Talk about the IRIS being the definition of a key-multi-value stores
    * Import the OpenAPI spec
    * See the objects are created? SQL-able?
* Relational model
    * Create tables via SQL
    * See that they are objects in IRIS
    * Do some fancy reports based on data in all the above models
* BI / Cubes
    * Ask BDB for help

Interesting things to point out
* A data model is a series of tools built on top of Globals and ObjectScript objects
* Community partners have created graph, timeseries, etc.  


# Redis API - Compares easily with COS

SET foo:bar "fido"
GET foo:bar
EXISTS foo:bar
DEL foo:bar
SET connections 10
INCR connections
DECR connections
DECRBY connections 2
EXPIRE connections 60
TTL connections <-- how much longer do you live
PERSIST connections
RPUSH friends "george"
LPUSH friends "fred"
LRANGE friends 0 -1
LPOP
RPOP
SADD superpowers "flight" "reflexes"
SREM superpowers "flight"
SISMEMBESR superpowers "flight"
They also have sorted sets (ZADD, ZDEL, ZRANGE, etc)
They also have hashes
